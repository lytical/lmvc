# lytical&reg; model-view-controller (lmvc)

## html markup
all view are associated with html elements via a declarative syntax as follows:

token : token

where each token is a segment in the url identifying the location of the view's module definition.
for example:

**my:form:item** identifies a view located in the module **my/form/item**
